This is the project for week 9-10 of the Star City Code School.  The goal of this project was to create a web app that was a hypothetical soccer league managment system.  You needed to be able to create players, create teams, and assign those players to specific teams.  We also created a user logging in and out feature using Sorcery.  Another feature that was added was a "Contact Us" feature that would allow someone to enter their name and email and an information request would be sent to sccssoccerproject@gmail.com as a way for a user to ask for more information about the league.  We are in the process of adding in a feature that will alow a user to enter in their email and using the ActionMailer feature of rails it will generate an email that will go directly to the users entered email.  Styling was done on a limited basis as this projectfocused more on using rails generators, Sorcery, and ActionMailer.
